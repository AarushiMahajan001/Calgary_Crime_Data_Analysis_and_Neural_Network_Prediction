# Calgary_Crime_Data_Analysis_and_Neural_Network_Prediction
The project aims to predict future crime rates using Crime and Disorder Data from the City of Calgary's website, covering 2018-2024. The goal is to create and refine a neural network model to predict future crime rates after analyzing the data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns in Calgary.

Strategy
1. Loading the data and understanding the data
2. Data Preprocessing - cleaing the data and preparing it for analysis
3. Exploratory Data Analysis - Analyzing the data to understand the trends and
patterns
4. Building a Neural Network Model
5. Optimizing the model
6. Training the model
7. Predicting the number of crimes that will occur in the future
